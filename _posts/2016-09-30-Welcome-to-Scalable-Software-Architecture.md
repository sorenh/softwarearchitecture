I'm delighted to present **{{ site.title }}**.

During a job interview a few days ago, I found myself saying something I had said numerous times before without really thinking too much about it.

It was about building highly available, scalable services. About how many projects and the people involved in those projects seem to fundamentally not get it.

So, instead of complaining, I figure I'll do something about it. Fixing everything myself isn't scalable (see what I did there?), so I'm going to try to help others get a better grasp of the principles. Here's how I figure it's going to work:

I'll write a series of articles to explain everything in a very down-to-Earth sort of way. It won't be like a computer science text book, but a much more practical resource. I'll try to provide references to more actual text books, if you feel like you want more detail.

At the same time, I'll share relevant news articles, summarizing them, and adding references to the articles on this site.

I hope this will become a valuable resource to developers of all levels of experience. I'll need help finding a level of detail that works across the board, so please leave comments!
