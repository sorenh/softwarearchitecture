**{{ site.title }}** is series of articles about building software that will survive the harsh environment known as "The Real World". There are plenty of computer science text books on the subject, but this is meant as a practical resource, sprinkled with references to more actual text books, if you feel like you want more detail.

You will also find commentary on news articles, etc.

I hope this will become a valuable resource to developers of all levels of experience. I'll need help finding a level of detail that works across the board, so please leave comments!
